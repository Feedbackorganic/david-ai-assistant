# Content Creation Workflow

## Process Overview
When tasked with creating content, follow this consistent workflow:

1. **Read the idea** from the `Clippings` folder to understand the topic
2. **Study examples** in the `examples` folder to understand the desired style, tone, and format
3. **Research** the topic thoroughly to gather high-quality information
4. **Create final draft** that combines:
   - The topic from the idea
   - The style and tone from examples
   - Well-researched, high-quality content

## Folder Structure
- `Clippings/` - Simple markdown files containing content topics/concepts and ideas
- `examples/` - Reference materials showing desired style, tone, and format
- `final drafts/` - Completed content pieces following the established style

## Important Notes
- Always maintain consistency with the style and tone demonstrated in examples
- Ensure thorough research before creating final drafts
- Each final draft should reflect both the idea's topic and the examples' approach
